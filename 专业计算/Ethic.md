## Lec-1-Introduction to Ethics and Professionalism 

#### Empirical（经验性的）

Ethical questions are  non-empirical（伦理问题是非经验性的）

Empirical and Non-Empirical Questions

我们只能通过考虑相关事实来回答经验问题。

我们不能仅仅通过考虑相关事实来回答非经验问题。



#### 研究ethic的意义

- Professionally required
- Preparation for future career
- Valuable in itself

**Ethics is not Relative(relativism IS WRONG)**

**There is some overlap between the law and ethics.** --- Some legal obligations are not ethical obligations



#### Professionalism and Codes of Ethics(专业主义和伦理准则)



## Lec-2-Moral Responsibility(道德责任)

### Responsibility

#### Cognitive Condition（认知能力）--- 无智者无错

- A person can only be morally responsible if they have certain **cognitive capacities**. 
- They must be able to reason about their actions before they decide whether or not to act, and be able to **understand the consequences.**

#### Epistemic Condition（认知状况）--- 无知者无错，应知而不知有错

- We only hold someone responsible if they have **sufficient information about the situation** 
-  A person can be morally responsible when they do not know what they are doing, if they **ought to have known**.

#### Voluntariness Condition（非自愿条件）--- 被强迫无错

- If a person does something due to compulsion or a lack of control, they are not morally responsible.

#### Causal Condition（因果条件）--- 无关者

- A person is morally responsible only if their actions make a difference to the relevant outcome

### 计算机责任追究的难点

#### Many Hands

Development of computer programs typically involves many programmers.

很难将责任分配给任何特定的个人。

#### Bug

We use the term ‘bug’ rather than ‘error’ because,
given the complexity of computer systems, some
bugs are inevitable.

电脑系统的复杂，错误是难免的

#### Blaming the Computer

- A Mediating Role
  - 计算机在人类意图和最终结果之间起到了中介的作用
- Human-Like Qualities
  - 随着技术的发展，计算机被赋予了许多原本由人类执行的任务，如计算、组织和记忆等。这种功能上的替代使得人们开始将一些人类的特质，如思考和意图，投射到计算机上。（误认为他有超越代码的主动性）

#### Ownership Without Liability（所有权而无责任）

利益与责任不对等，公司开发者会称：软件是按照现状提供，用户应当承担风险。但公司依然获取利润

#### Tech as Ethically Neutral（技术是中立的）

### 案例

Case Study: Therac-25

#### Responsibility Issues

- **Developers and Company**: The developers and the company are primarily responsible due to software defects and inadequate safety testing. They failed to ensure the system's safety and reliability.
- **Operators**: Operators also bear some responsibility for not taking appropriate action when faced with error messages and patient feedback.
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Regulatory agencies share some responsibility for not identifying and preventing potential safety risks during the approval and supervision process.

### An alternative approach to responsibility

- **Blame**: We have utilised a conception of moral responsibility in terms of blame
- **Positive:**
  - Recognising the outcomes of one’s actions and recognising when one has been involved in an action or project that has negative effects on others
  - Seeking to mitigate harms caused
  - Seeking to avoid repetition.

## Lec-3-Challenging Authority

这里有一个人物 Stanley Milgram进行了实验

实验就是电椅实验，实验人员作为施暴者看一看是不是真的可以拒绝施暴，但效果很差

#### 在工程领域

technician's often blind devotion to his task, tech as Ethically Neutral

Such distancing tends to diffuse responsibility, making it easier (practically and psychologically) to shirk accountability for the ultimate consequences of one’s work.

这种疏远倾向于分散责任，使其更容易（实际上和心理上）逃避对一个人工作的后果的责任。

#### Summary

**Challenging Authority**: It emphasizes the need for professionals to have the courage to question authority when faced with unethical demands, as demonstrated through historical and contemporary case studies.
通过历史和当代案例，强调在面对权威时，专业人士需要具备挑战权威的勇气和责任感.给我英语



## Lec-4-Surveillance and Privacy(监控与私隐)

### Surveillance的坏处

- Privacy --- 缺乏隐私 --- freedom，autonomy，Intimacy
- Trust --- 缺乏信任 
- Authenticity --- 做自己

### 动机（好处）

- Security --- deterrence，deterrence
- Information --- collect data
- Health and Safety --- parent monitor child
-  Efficiency

### Balance

- Necessity --- 必要情况下监察
- Proportionality --- 权衡监察的比例 The level and type of surveillance should be appropriate  considering the severity of the problem that it is supposed to solve --- 大事监察，小事不查
- Discrimination --- 不同的人不同对待



## Lec-5-Hacking and Property

#### Different Hats

“White hat” --- “Black hat” --- “Grey hat”

#### 关键点

- Privacy

  - A person has privacy insofar as they are able to control/decide who  knows about them and who can perceive them.

- Property(财产) 

  - **控制权**：Property is an extension of yourself, and you have the same rights  to control it as to control your own body.
  - **所有权**：Property is the product of your own hard work, and you should be entitled to the benefits of it（财产是你自己辛勤劳动的产物，你应该有权享受它的好处。）
  - **使用权：**We find property valuable because it is useful, and it allows us to  do certain things.

- Consent（许可）

  Generally speaking, it is wrong for anyone else to do something to my body or property without my consent.（可以理解为的支配财产的权力）

### 事例

- Tinkode入侵网站并告知管理者错误但被惩罚
- 自由软件运动不合规
- Aaron Schwartz搬运论文网站被罚

## Lec-6-Equality, Diversity, and Computing

#### Stereotype（刻板印象）

#### Distributive Injustice（分配不公）

Discrimination causes distributive injustice when people receive fewer benefits (or greater harms, burdens, risks), due to their demographic group (eg. race, gender).

#### Recognitional Injustice（司法不公）

Discrimination causes recognitional injustice when it fails to treat
everyone’s needs and wellbeing as being of equal importance.
